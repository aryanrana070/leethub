Let's break down the code with an example:

Code:

import java.util.Scanner;

class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt(); // Read the number of elements
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Initialize answer with a large value

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int currNum = sc.nextInt(); // Read the current number
            int currX = 0; // Initialize the count of divisions for the current number

            while (currNum % 2 == 0) { // While the current number is even
                currNum /= 2; // Divide the current number by 2
                currX++; // Increment the count of divisions
            }

            ans = Math.min(ans, currX); // Update the answer with the minimum count
        }

        System.out.println(ans); // Print the final answer
    }
}


Example:

Input: 8 12 40

1. n = 3 (number of elements)
2. ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE (initialize answer with a large value)

Iteration 1:

- currNum = 8
- currX = 0
- While 8 is even:
    - 8 becomes 4 (divided by 2)
    - currX becomes 1
    - 4 becomes 2 (divided by 2)
    - currX becomes 2
    - 2 becomes 1 (divided by 2)
    - currX becomes 3
- ans is updated with Math.min(Integer.MAX_VALUE, 3) = 3

Iteration 2:

- currNum = 12
- currX = 0
- While 12 is even:
    - 12 becomes 6 (divided by 2)
    - currX becomes 1
    - 6 becomes 3 (divided by 2)
    - currX becomes 2
- ans is updated with Math.min(3, 2) = 2

Iteration 3:

- currNum = 40
- currX = 0
- While 40 is even:
    - 40 becomes 20 (divided by 2)
    - currX becomes 1
    - 20 becomes 10 (divided by 2)
    - currX becomes 2
    - 10 becomes 5 (divided by 2)
    - currX becomes 3
- ans is updated with Math.min(2, 3) = 2

Final answer:

- ans = 2 (minimum count of divisions)

The code finds the minimum number of divisions by 2 required to make each number odd, and prints the minimum of these counts. In this example, the output is 2 because both 12 and 40 require 2 divisions by 2 to become odd, which is the minimum count.

with array to print each element:
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();  // Number of elements
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;  // Variable to track the minimum count of divisions by 2
        int[] currNum = new int[n];  // Initialize the array with size n

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currNum[i] = sc.nextInt();  // Read each element into the array
            int currX = 0;  // Counter for the number of divisions by 2

            while (currNum[i] % 2 == 0) {  // Count divisions by 2
                currNum[i] /= 2;
                currX++;
            }

            ans = Math.min(ans, currX);  // Update the minimum count of divisions by 2
        }

        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(currNum)); // Print the modified array
        System.out.println(ans);  // Print the minimum count of divisions by 2
    }
}
output for array 8 12 40
[1, 3, 5]
