not able to understand this part :
Window: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (windowEnd = 11)

zeroSwaps = 4
Move windowStart until zeroSwaps <= k (now windowStart = 1)
Max Ones = remains 11
Window: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] (windowEnd = 12)

zeroSwaps = 4
Move windowStart until zeroSwaps <= k (now windowStart = 3)
Max Ones = remains 11
Window: [1, 1] (windowEnd = 13)

zeroSwaps = 3
Max Ones = 11 (0's present)
Window: [1, 1] (windowEnd = 14)

zeroSwaps = 3
Max Ones = 11 (0's present)
explain why it shift to right,if you explain with index number also then i will get it maybe.
also explain which line is calcukating max number of 1s  and which is swaping 0 with example in detials
